### Known Issues with React Native Compatibility

We encountered the following issues when integrating the Azure Communication Services UI Library with React Native across different versions:

#### iOS Issue (React Native 0.69.4)

- **Problem**: During pod installation on iOS, an error occurs:
  ```
  [!] Invalid Podfile file: undefined method `prepare_react_native_project!' for #Pod::Podfile:0x0000000156297d98.
  ```
- **Cause**: This issue stems from compatibility concerns with React Native version 0.69.4.

#### Android Issue (React Native 0.72.6)

- **Problem**: Android has compatibility issues on React Native version 0.72.6.

#### Current Challenge (React Native 0.69.4)

- **Outcome**: With React Native 0.69.4, Android functions as expected, but iOS pod installations fail. The required pods seem compatible only with React Native version 0.72.6.

### Next Steps

We are hopeful that future updates to the library will resolve these compatibility challenges. For now, we suggest monitoring updates and experimenting with different React Native versions if possible.

Best of luck to those working with similar configurations!
